# PandAna 3

The PandAna 3 project is a re-working of PandAna to provide higher
efficiency for parallel calculations.

## Testing

All tests can be run from the project top-level (this directory),
using the command `pytest`. Some tests require the file `small.h5`;
this file can be created by first running `tools/make_small_file`.
